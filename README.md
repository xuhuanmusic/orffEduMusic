> **Real-time rhythmic feedback for children's Orff music education using deep learning**
> This repository contains the official implementation of **orffEduMusic**, an AI system designed to detect timing deviations in children’s musical performances (ages 4–8) and provide developmentally appropriate feedback. The model is trained via transfer learning from adult groove data and fine-tuned on child-specific recordings.
> Accepted for publication in *PeerJ Computer Science* as an **AI Application**.
